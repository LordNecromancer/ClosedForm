# ClosedForm

Closed form for recursive sequences :
  load and run class ClosedForm.Enter the sequence with this   format : x(n)=sx(n-1)+tx(n-2). where s,t are real numbers.
  then enter the two first step of the sequence.It'll use 
  charactristic root theorem to find the closed form.
  
  this project was created as a hobby.
